 *  \section intro_sec Introduction
 * BMP085 digital Altimeter Programming Interface
 * The BMP085 API enables quick access to Bosch Sensortec's digital altimeter.
 * The only mandatory steps are: 
 *
 * 1. linking the target application's communication functions to the API (\ref BMP085_WR_FUNC_PTR, \ref BMP085_RD_FUNC_PTR)
 *
 * 2. calling the bmp085_init() routine, which initializes all necessary data structures for using all functions
